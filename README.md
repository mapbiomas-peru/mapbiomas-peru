# 🌎 MapBiomas Peru — LULC Collection 3 (1985–2024)

## 🧭 Overview

**Collection 3** is the third official annual Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) time series produced by MapBiomas Peru, covering the period **1985–2024** at 30 m spatial resolution.

This collection represents a major advancement in thematic detail, legend refinement, and classification consistency. It integrates methodological improvements, expanded class hierarchy, and enhanced post-classification strategies to improve temporal coherence and spatial reliability.

The full processing workflow is implemented in Google Earth Engine (GEE), including mosaic generation, feature engineering, classification modeling, temporal filtering, and validation procedures.

The methodological foundation is documented in the official ATBD:

## ✨ What’s New in Collection 3

Collection 3 expands the legend from **19 classes (Collection 2)** to **26 classes**, introducing greater thematic detail and a more structured hierarchy.

Key updates include:

- 🌿 **Expanded non-forest formations**
  - Addition of: Rocky Outcrop, Fog Oasis, and Other non-forest formations  
  - Refinement of flooded and scrubland classes  

- 🌾 **Agricultural disaggregation**
  - Agriculture now subdivided into:
    - Oil palm  
    - Rice  
    - Other crops  

- 🏖 **Refined non-vegetated areas**
  - New classes: Beach and Coastal Salt Flat  
  - Clear distinction between natural and anthropogenic non-vegetated surfaces  

- 🧩 **Improved legend hierarchy**
  - Greater ecological specificity  
  - Enhanced transition analysis and thematic consistency  

Collection 3 represents the most detailed and ecologically refined LULC classification produced by MapBiomas Peru to date.

### 🛰 Methodological Improvements

- Updated training datasets with expanded spatial coverage  
- Improved Random Forest configuration  
- Enhanced temporal and spatial filtering  
- Greater consistency across biome boundaries
